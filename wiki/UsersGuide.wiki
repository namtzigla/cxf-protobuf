<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

== Introduction ==

cxf-protobuf is a simple integration of [http://cxf.apache.org/ Apache CXF], an open source services framework and [http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ Google's Protocol Buffers]. The main features are

   * *server API for publishing a service that can process protocol buffer messages* 
   * *client API for sending messages to protocol buffer services using CXF's transport infrastructure*
   * *support for both RPC-style dispatching and single message handler style implementation on the server-side*
   * *integration with CXF's (Spring) configuration*
   * *description generation for protocol buffer services ?wsdl-style (adopted from the SOAP world)* 

== Examples ==

You can get the examples at the downloads page. You will need maven to build them. As an alternative, you can get the following jars manually and compile the examples against them with any tool or IDE you like:
   * CXF jars and dependencies
   * cxf-protobuf jar

=== Example 1: !AddressBook service ===

All examples are built around the "address book" protocol buffer sample that you can find in [http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/javatutorial.html Google's tutorial]: 


{{{
package tutorial;

option java_package = "com.example.tutorial";
option java_outer_classname = "AddressBookProtos";

message Person {
  required string name = 1;
  required int32 id = 2;
  optional string email = 3;

  enum PhoneType {
    MOBILE = 0;
    HOME = 1;
    WORK = 2;
  }

  message PhoneNumber {
    required string number = 1;
    optional PhoneType type = 2 [default = HOME];
  }

  repeated PhoneNumber phone = 4;
}

message AddressBook {
  repeated Person person = 1;
}
}}}

First I added a few extra messages to the ad


=== Example 2: !AddressBook client ===

=== Example 3: !AddressBook service configured in Spring ===

=== Example 4: !AddressBook message handler service ===

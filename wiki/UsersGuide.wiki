== Introduction ==

cxf-protobuf is a simple integration of Apache CXF, an open source application services framework and Google's Protocol Buffers. The main features are

   * *server API for publishing a service that can process protocol buffer messages* 
   * *client API for sending messages to protocol buffer services using CXF's transport infrastructure*
   * *support for both RPC-style dispatching and single message handler style implementation on the server-side*
   * *integration with CXF's (Spring) configuration*
   * *description generation for protocol buffer services ?wsdl-style (adopted from the SOAP world)*
